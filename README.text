In this project, we will build a recombining tree to price options (both american and european options). 
We consider a discrete time model of N steps and a maturity of T.
The economy here has numerous regimes which influence the fluctuation of asset prices. 
We follow the model presented in the joined pdf file.
Options prices obtained with our tree is then compared to the prices obtained through Heston model. 
We invite you to read the pdf part 3 to know about Heston model.
Reading the file is also recommended for further understanding of the code and different formula.
